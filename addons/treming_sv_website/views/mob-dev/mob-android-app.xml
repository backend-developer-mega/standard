                            <br></br>

                            <h4 class="f-nrsthin orange bold" >Android Application Prototyping</h4>
                            <p> Many of our startup customers want to build a prototype so that they can pitch their idea to investors. At Treming, we make sure your requirements are well

                                documented before we begin building the prototype Android application to a level where it can be demoed to an audience. Once you get funded, the existing prototype

                                app stack becomes the base for the entire development cycle. Since we are a software house, we can take care of your backend web services needs as well.

                                Working with Treming gives you have an expert team of Android developers, creative designers with experience in UI/UX design, quality assurance testers with

                                access to the latest tools, project managers, and software design architects.</p><br></br>

                            <p> Each customer is different. In some cases, an established business has enough

                                capital to start directly on the development of an Android App. Our team will work

                                closely with the customerâ€™s team to gather and document the requirements. Most of

                                the initial meetings will be over WebEx or Skype. We will start working on

                                the actual Android app development once everyone agrees on the architecture of

                                the solution and has signed the project proposal. We will do the final work of

                                submitting the app to the Android Google Play store and will work with Google to

                                get it approved as quickly as possible.</p><br></br>


                            <p>In most cases, we work on Android app development projects on a fixed cost basis.

                                You can also choose the Time and Material or Full Time Staffing options.
