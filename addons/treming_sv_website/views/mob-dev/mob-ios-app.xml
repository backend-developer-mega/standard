                            <p>Treming has hands on experience in building native iOS applications for all of your needs. Our iOS application development expertise includes:</p>
                            <br></br>

                            <h4 class="f-nrsthin orange bold" >iOS Application Prototyping</h4>

                            <p> Many of our startup customers want to build a prototype so that they can pitch their

                                idea to investors. At Treming, we make sure your requirements are well

                                documented before we begin building the prototype iOS application to a level where

                                it can be demoed to an audience. Once you get funded, the existing prototype app

                                stack becomes the base for the entire development cycle. Since we are a software

                                house, we can take care of your backend web services needs as well. Working with

                                Treming gives you an expert team of iOS developers, creative designers with

                                experience in UI/UX design, quality assurance testers with access to the latest tools,

                                project managers and software design architects.</p><br></br>
                            <h4 class="f-nrsthin orange bold">iOS App Development</h4>
                            <p> Each customer is different. In some cases, we are not dealing with a startup and the

                                established business has enough in their budget to get started on the development

                                of an iOS App. Our team will work closely with the customerâ€™s team to gather and

                                document the requirements for the application. Most of the initial meetings will be

                                over WebEx or Skype. We will start working on the actual iOS App

                                development once everyone agrees on the architecture of the solution and has

                                signed the project proposal. We will do the final work of submitting the app on the

                                iOS app store and work with Apple to get it approved quickly.</p><br></br>


                            <p>In most cases, we work on iOS projects on a fixed cost basis but you can also opt for

                                Time and Material or Full Time Staffing options. </p>
