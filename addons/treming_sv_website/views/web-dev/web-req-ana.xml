                            <p>The first process on any web project is to understand and analyze the requirements.

                                At Treming, we make sure we understand the project requirements in detail before

                                we begin. One of the main reasons for this is because most of our projects are fixed

                                price projects which protects both parties.</p>
                            <p>The requirements collection process is done at the customer facility in person or

                                through online conferencing such as WebEx or Skype.</p>
                            <p>Once the requirements are all understood and documented, our technical team will

                                work on a Work Breakdown Structure spreadsheet for the project which has all the

                                details like tasks, hours per task, total cost, assumptions, technology stack and

                                deadlines for the project.</p>
                            <p>The WBS will become a detailed proposal once it is approved by the customer

                                project manager. All projects have clear milestones and deadlines. There will be a

                                weekly meeting with the customer for a maximum of 45 minutes, depending on the

                                size of the project. Such meetings showcase to the customer what tasks were

                                completed in the previous week as well as what tasks are planned for the coming

                                week. Most importantly, any questions or concerns about the project are discussed.

                                This time is also utilized if there is anything to be demoed. This mechanism helps us

                                to avoid any deviation from actual project scope and helps us to have 100%

                                customer satisfaction.</p>
